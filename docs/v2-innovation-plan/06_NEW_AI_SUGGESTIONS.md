# New AI Suggestions (Staying Ahead of the Curve)

This document outlines additional, cutting-edge AI features that can be implemented in FastEat Client V2 to maintain a competitive advantage and provide a truly next-generation user experience.

## 1. AI Voice Ordering (The "Drive-Thru" Experience)

### 1.1. Concept
Allow users to order food using natural language voice commands, similar to talking to a human at a drive-thru or a high-end concierge.

### 1.2. Workflow
1.  **Trigger:** User taps a prominent microphone icon on the home screen or search bar.
2.  **Speech-to-Text (STT):** The app records the audio and sends it to a fast STT service (e.g., OpenAI Whisper, Deepgram).
3.  **Intent Parsing (LLM):** The transcribed text (e.g., "Quiero dos hamburguesas con queso, sin cebolla, y unas papas grandes de McDonald's") is sent to an LLM.
4.  **Action Execution:** The LLM extracts the intent, restaurant, items, quantities, and modifiers, and returns a structured JSON payload.
5.  **Cart Population:** The app automatically adds the items to the cart and presents a confirmation screen: *"¿Confirmar tu pedido de McDonald's?"*

### 1.3. Technical Considerations
*   **Latency is Key:** The entire process (STT -> LLM -> UI Update) must happen in under 3 seconds to feel magical. Use streaming APIs where possible.
*   **Context Awareness:** The LLM must have access to the user's location and past orders to resolve ambiguities (e.g., "Lo de siempre" or "El sushi de la esquina").

## 2. AI Image Enhancement for Restaurants

### 2.1. Concept
Many local, independent restaurants struggle with poor-quality food photography, which drastically lowers conversion rates. FastEat can offer an automated AI enhancement pipeline.

### 2.2. Workflow
1.  **Upload:** A restaurant partner uploads a photo of a dish (e.g., a poorly lit, unappetizing taco).
2.  **AI Processing:** The image is sent to an AI image-to-image model (e.g., Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, or a specialized food enhancement API).
3.  **Enhancement:** The AI automatically corrects lighting, color balance, sharpness, and even generates a clean, appetizing background (e.g., a wooden table or a solid color).
4.  **Review & Publish:** The restaurant reviews the enhanced image and approves it for their menu.

### 2.3. Value Proposition
*   **For Restaurants:** Higher sales without the cost of a professional photographer.
*   **For FastEat:** A visually stunning app that looks premium, increasing overall user trust and order volume.

## 3. Dynamic AI Promotions & Push Notifications

### 3.1. Concept
Move away from generic, batch-and-blast push notifications ("¡15% de descuento hoy!") to hyper-personalized, context-aware messages generated by AI.

### 3.2. Workflow
1.  **Data Ingestion:** A background job collects real-time data: User's order history, current weather (e.g., raining, hot), time of day, and active restaurant promotions.
2.  **Prompt Generation:** The system constructs a prompt for the LLM: *"User X usually orders soup when it rains. It is currently raining in their area. Restaurant Y has a 10% discount on Pho. Write a short, engaging push notification in Costa Rican Spanish."*
3.  **Delivery:** The LLM generates the copy (e.g., *"¡Qué aguacero! 🌧️ Un Pho calientito de Y te llega en 20 min con 10% de descuento."*) and sends it via the push notification service.

### 3.3. Technical Considerations
*   **Cost Control:** Generating unique copy for thousands of users can be expensive. Group users into micro-segments (e.g., "Rainy day soup lovers in San José") and generate one message per segment.
*   **A/B Testing:** Continuously A/B test AI-generated copy against human-written copy to measure effectiveness and optimize the prompts.
