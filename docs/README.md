## Retention policy

Keep these categories versioned in Git:

- Good practices (`standards/`)
- Future implementation plans (`plans/`)
- Already implemented plans (`plans/implemented/`)
- Useful tips and runbooks (`tips/`)
- App knowledge and contracts (`knowledge/`)

Generated test/performance reports should be generated on-demand and should not be committed unless explicitly needed for an audit.
